# Automation of Testing Scenarios of HPE Verity

In the realization or implementation of any software application, Test automation plays an integral role. For any organization, budget 
and the timeline are the most essential and fundamental aspects. Development and testing must be accommodated within the stipulated economic 
and timeframe of any organization. This is one of the driving forces for accelerating the process of testing. The result obtained as a 
consequence is the Test Automation.


Automated Testing is an essential procedure which makes the testing faster and more reliable. The time to arrive to the market must be 
reduced as there is huge competition in the business ecosystem. The quality of the product, which is of primary significance, can be maintained 
and improved by making this well-structured automated testing. Another advantage of automating the testing process is that new builds can be 
verified autonomously by re-deploying appropriate code, thus ensuring functionality is not broken in present and future releases.


An application functioning as desired relies on it working with accurate and complete data in the back-end. Therein lies the importance of 
thoroughly verifying and validating that the data that goes into the back-end is accurate. This also shines light on the limits of the 
application and sets specific bounds on the input, while also exposing flaws in the logic, and presents areas of improvement in the same.


Therefore, the scope and purpose of Test Automation and Validation is far-reaching and hence, there is ample room for enhancements, improvements 
and learning. This project is carried out in order to understand the benefits of the automated testing process and develop expertise in various 
industry-standard tools for the same.
